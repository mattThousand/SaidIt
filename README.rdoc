A sentiment analysis app built using Ember and Rails. I am using this project as an exercise to build my knowledge of Ember, but the result is actually pretty cool: visit the app (saidit.herokuapp.com), enter any twitter handle, and generate a sentiment breakdown of the lanuguage contained in that tweeter's 20 most recent tweets.  

Thanks for checking SaidIt out!  PRs are always welcome :)
