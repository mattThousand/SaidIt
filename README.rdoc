A sentiment analysis app built using Ember.js and Rails. I am using this project as an exercise to build my knowledge of Ember.js (and D3.js), but the result is actually pretty cool: visit the app (saidit.herokuapp.com), enter any twitter handle, and generate a simple visualization of the sentiment expressed by that tweeter's 20 most recent tweets.  

Thanks for checking SaidIt out!  PRs are always welcome :)
